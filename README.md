# pwabuilder-components

The pwabuilder-components library is a collection of [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) that can be used to enable rich, native-like experiences on the Web.

These components work with any web framework and on all all modern browsers.

## This library is in Preview

This library is in preview and is in early development. Based on feedback from the community, all components and APIs are expected to change and improve.

## Getting Started

You can use our components by adding the following script tag to your index.html:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/pwabuilder-components/dist/esm/index.js"></script>
```

Once you have added this script tag you can use the components like so:

```html
<h3>
  Geolocation Component
</h3>
<pwb-geolocation></pwb-geolocation>

<h3>
  Clipboard component
</h3>
<pwb-clipboard texttocopy="Hello World"></pwb-clipboard>
```
